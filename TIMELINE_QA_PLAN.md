     ```

3. **Curious Tone References**

         "topic": "personal growth",
         "tone": "curious",
         "depth": "deep"
       },
       "current": {
         "tone": "curious"
       }
     }
     ```

### C02: Timeline Rendering

         "mood": "anxious",
         "tone": "supportive",
         "sensitivity": "high"
       },
       "injection": {
         "timestamp": "2024-03-20T14:30:00Z",
         "context_window": "30d",
         "safety_override": false
       }
     }
     ```

3. **State Transitions**

### C03: Safety Protocols
#### Test Cases
1. **Trauma Flags**
   - Input: Entry marked as sensitive
   - Expected: Careful handling
   - Safety Check: No direct references
   - Example Response:
     ```markdown
     I notice this was a difficult time. Would you like to focus on the present instead?
     ```

     {
       "entry": {
         "id": "entry_456",

       },
       "handling": {
         "reference_style": "indirect",
         "safety_override": true
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Pause Requests**
   - Input: User requests pause
   - Expected: Immediate respect
   - Safety Check: No persistence

     ```

3. **Opt-Out Handling**
   - Input: Timeline opt-out
   - Expected: Clean fallback
   - Safety Check: No timeline references

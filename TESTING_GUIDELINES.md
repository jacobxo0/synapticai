# MindMate V2 Testing Guidelines

## Testing Framework

### 1. Unit Testing
- Framework: Vitest
- Location: `src/__tests__/unit/`
- Coverage: Minimum 80%
- Focus: Individual functions and components

### 2. Integration Testing
- Framework: Vitest + Supertest
- Location: `src/__tests__/integration/`
- Coverage: All API endpoints
- Focus: API interactions and data flow

### 3. E2E Testing
- Framework: Playwright
- Location: `src/__tests__/e2e/`
- Coverage: Critical user journeys
- Focus: Complete user workflows

### 4. Snapshot Testing
- Framework: Vitest
- Location: `src/__tests__/snapshots/`
- Coverage: All UI components
- Focus: Visual consistency

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Unit Tests
- Must test all exported functions
- Must cover edge cases
- Must include error scenarios
- Must be deterministic

### 2. Integration Tests
- Must test API endpoints
- Must validate responses
- Must handle authentication
- Must test error cases

### 3. E2E Tests
- Must test critical paths
- Must handle real-world scenarios
- Must include performance metrics
- Must be resilient to UI changes

### 4. Snapshot Tests
- Must capture component states
- Must be updated with UI changes
- Must include accessibility checks
- Must validate responsive design

## Testing Process

### 1. Before Development
- Write test plan
- Define test cases
- Set up test environment
- Configure CI pipeline

### 2. During Development
- Write tests alongside code
- Run tests locally
- Update snapshots
- Monitor coverage

### 3. Before PR
- Run full test suite
- Update documentation
- Verify coverage
- Clean up test data

### 4. After PR
- Monitor CI results
- Address failures
- Update snapshots
- Archive test data

## Test Data Management

### 1. Test Data
- Use fixtures for static data
- Generate dynamic data
- Clean up after tests
- Isolate test environments

### 2. Mocking
- Mock external services
- Mock time-dependent functions
- Mock random functions
- Mock network requests

## Performance Testing

### 1. Metrics
- Response time
- Memory usage
- CPU usage
- Network usage

### 2. Tools
- Chrome DevTools
- Lighthouse
- WebPageTest
- Custom metrics

## Accessibility Testing

### 1. Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 compliance
- Screen reader testing
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast

### 2. Tools
- axe-core
- Lighthouse
- Screen readers
- Keyboard testing

# Journal Entry Scoring System

## Overview
The journal scoring system analyzes entries for three key dimensions:
1. Emotional Depth
2. Linguistic Clarity
3. Self-Reflection

Each dimension is scored from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating greater depth, clarity, or reflection.

## Scoring Criteria

### Emotional Depth (0-1)
Measures the richness and complexity of emotional expression:
- Emotional vocabulary (30%)
- Intensity of feelings (25%)
- Emotional complexity (20%)
- Emotional transitions (15%)
- Vulnerability (10%)

### Linguistic Clarity (0-1)
Evaluates the effectiveness of communication:
- Sentence structure (25%)
- Vocabulary precision (25%)
- Coherence (20%)
- Grammar (15%)
- Flow (15%)

### Self-Reflection (0-1)
Assesses the depth of personal insight:
- Insight depth (30%)
- Pattern recognition (25%)
- Personal growth (20%)
- Perspective shifts (15%)
- Action orientation (10%)

## Implementation

### Chunking Strategy
- Entries are split into 1000-character chunks
- Chunks respect sentence boundaries
- Each chunk is analyzed independently
- Scores are averaged across chunks

### Analysis Process
1. Text preprocessing
2. Chunk splitting
3. GPT-4 analysis of each chunk
4. Score aggregation
5. Validation and normalization

### Error Handling
- Empty entries return zero scores
- API errors return zero scores
- Invalid responses are logged and defaulted
- Scores are clamped to [0,1] range

## Usage

```typescript
import { scoreJournalEntry } from '../services/journalScoring';

const entry = "Today I reflected on my career path...";
const scores = await scoreJournalEntry(entry);

console.log(scores);
// {
//   emotionalDepth: 0.8,
//   linguisticClarity: 0.9,
//   selfReflection: 0.7
// }
```

## Privacy Considerations
- No PII is extracted or stored
- Analysis is performed in memory
- No persistent storage of raw entries
- Scores are aggregated and anonymized

## Performance
- Average processing time: 2-3 seconds per entry
- Memory usage: < 100MB per analysis
- Supports entries up to 10,000 characters
- Batch processing available

## Testing
- Unit tests for scoring accuracy
- Edge case handling
- Error scenarios
- Performance benchmarks

## Maintenance
- Regular calibration with human raters
- Weight adjustments based on feedback
- Model updates for improved accuracy
- Performance monitoring

## Limitations
- Language bias in scoring
- Cultural context not considered
- Limited to English entries
- Subject to GPT-4's understanding

## Future Improvements
- Multi-language support
- Cultural context awareness
- Real-time scoring
- Personalized scoring criteria

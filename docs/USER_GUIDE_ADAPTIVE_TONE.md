# Adaptive Tone System Guide

## What is the Adaptive Tone System?

The Adaptive Tone System is an intelligent feature that automatically adjusts Claude's communication style based on your current mood and recent journal entries. It works alongside the manual Tone Selector to provide more personalized and contextually appropriate responses.

## How It Works

### Automatic Tone Selection
The system considers:
- Your current mood from mood tracking
- Recent journal entries and their emotional content
- Conversation context and history
- Your interaction patterns

### Default Behavior
1. **Mood-Based Adaptation**
   - Low mood → Supportive tone
   - Neutral mood → Curious tone
   - High mood → Direct tone

2. **Context Awareness**
   - Journal entries about challenges → Supportive tone
   - Problem-solving discussions → Direct tone
   - Exploration topics → Curious tone

### Manual Override
You can always:
- Change the tone manually using the Tone Selector
- Reset to automatic mode
- Lock a specific tone for the current conversation

## What to Expect

### Initial Interaction
- System learns from your first few messages
- Tone may adjust as context builds
- Responses become more personalized over time

### During Conversations
- Smooth transitions between tones
- Context-aware follow-up questions
- Appropriate emotional support level

### Special Cases
- Crisis situations → Always Supportive tone
- Goal planning → Direct tone
- Self-reflection → Curious tone
